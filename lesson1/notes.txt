What I learned today is what hardware and software is and some parts of the computer.
Hardware: Processor ( Central Processing Unit), motherboard, fan, Random Access Memory, hard drive, network card, Input/Output devices, and this computer's $1000 graphics driver!
Software: Operating system, text editor, file browser.
Graphical User Interface
Terminal: 'ls' lists everything in the file thing. 'cd(meaning change directory) documents' takes you into documents, 'pwd' print working directory.
To make a directory from the terminal, type mkdir -v (type name of what you want the directory to be called.) The verbose thing tells you it made it. It still works if you don't type -v.
