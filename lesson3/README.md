# Lesson 3
This is my lesson 3 test. I have to pass in order to play Fortnite.

## Notes
We started using github today. use git add -A to add new files. To commit, use git commit -m "initial commit. We also created an ssh key.
Then we added it to github.
git branch -M main
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:semarks/computerclass.git
This is an important command thingy: git push -u origin main
That pushes everything that's new to github.
